## A design template for android named CriminalIntent ##
This code is completely adopted from the book `android programming the big nerd ranch guide second edition`.  
The code however is written by me and i think it is useful for my next android projects so here is a good place to store that!  
The app is fully based on `OOP` design and icing on it's cake is very straightforward.  
In the next couple of days i probably will add some libraries to the app to make it more beautiful if my assignments let me!
